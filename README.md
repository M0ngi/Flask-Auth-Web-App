# Flask Web App

This is a simple project which I've created as a small practice to use Flask. I used some templates available online & I made some modifications on them.
This project was created mainly for the back-end side so I didn't focus much on the front-end.

This project contains:
* Login/Registration system, using JWT for session management.
* A role verification system (Administrator/User).
* A RESTful API for the following actions: Auth (Login, Signup, Logout), Listing users, Listing roles.


Summary of what I used:
* Flask for creating the web app, adding routes...
* SQLAlchemy for creating the models & the database.
* PyJWT for JWT authentification.
